documentation later...

use for reference, not production.

master is not up to date.

some parts were used in production, but i like staying on top of the bleeding edge (only things that improve dev happiness of course), so most parts were not.


Todo:
- [ ] different stylesheets for non reusable components on the web?
- [ ] upload statics to S3?
